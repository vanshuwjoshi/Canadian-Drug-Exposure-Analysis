# Non-Medical Drug Exposure Among Canadian People

## Overview

This GitHub repository presents a data analysis project created during the ASA DataFest. Our team aimed to investigate non-medical drug exposure among people in Canada. The project delves into understanding the prevalence of drug or medication usage without a prescription within this demographic group. We conducted an in-depth analysis, comparing drug abuse patterns based on various factors such as gender, income, and province.

## ASA DataFest

[ASA DataFest](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Education/ASA-DataFest.aspx) is an annual data analysis competition that brings together students to work on real-world data challenges. This project was developed as part of our participation in DataFest.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:

1. To assess the extent of non-medical drug exposure among people in Canada.
2. To identify trends and patterns in drug abuse within this population.
3. To explore how non-medical drug exposure varies based on factors such as gender, income levels, and province of residence.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: We rigorously cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted an EDA to gain insights into the data, uncover trends, and identify potential relationships between variables.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilized various statistical techniques to quantify drug exposure rates and assess their significance.

- **Data Visualization**: Created compelling visualizations using Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to present our findings effectively.

## Key Findings

Our analysis revealed crucial insights into non-medical drug exposure among Aboriginal people in Canada. We observed variations in drug abuse patterns across different demographics, including gender, income levels, and province of residence.
